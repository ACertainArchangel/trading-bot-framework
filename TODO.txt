3 months before Dec 17 2025 is bullish
3 months before that is bearish. 
backtest both periods to see which strats are best in each market and which are robust across both, ensuring no contradictions with results from backtest_greedy_momentum.py

Then manually test the 3 best over both periods to validate. Verify the backtest works by using test_bot which we know works. Get the data and calculate by hand to make sure it does the same thing exactly.

then launch the best 1.

then work on live bot-ing those top 2 or 3 in parallel.
